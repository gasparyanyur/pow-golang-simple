Challenge: The challenge is a string generated by the server, like "challenge-123456".

Nonce: The client tries different nonces (numbers) and appends them to the challenge to produce a hash.

Target: The hash must meet the target condition, like starting with a certain number of zeroes ("0000").


The server generates a challenge, which is typically a random string or a combination of some user-specific data (e.g., challenge-123456). This challenge is sent to the client.

Step 2: Solving PoW (Client Side)
The client will use a nonce (a random number) and concatenate it with the challenge to generate a string. The client then hashes the concatenated string (using a hashing algorithm like SHA-256). The goal is to find a nonce such that the resulting hash meets a specific target condition.

For example:

Challenge: "challenge-123456"

Nonce: 42

The client concatenates these two: "challenge-12345642"

Then it hashes the string: sha256("challenge-12345642").

The resulting hash is checked to see if it starts with four zeroes (e.g., "0000"). If it does, this nonce is valid.

Step 3: Hashing the Challenge + Nonce
The client uses a hashing algorithm like SHA-256 to hash the combined challenge + nonce string. It continues incrementing the nonce and hashing until it finds a valid nonce.

For example:

go
Копировать
data := challenge + strconv.Itoa(nonce) // Concatenate challenge and nonce
hash := fmt.Sprintf("%x", sha256.Sum256([]byte(data))) // Hash the concatenated string
The client checks whether the hash starts with "0000" (the target condition). If the hash matches the target condition, the nonce is considered valid.

Step 4: Verification (Server Side)
Once the client sends the challenge and the valid nonce back to the server, the server:

Concatenates the challenge and nonce.

Hashes the concatenated string.

Verifies that the hash starts with the required number of zeroes (the target condition).

If the hash matches the target, the server knows the client has performed the required work and grants access to the resource (the quote).
